## Langchain Learning Note üìö

### Overview üîç

The Langchain learning note provides insights into the architecture and components of conversational agents developed using Ollama tools. Here are some key points:

1. **Chain Architecture**: The conversational agent consists of several components arranged in a chain, including the Language Model (LLM), parser, and memory. This architecture enables various functionalities like conversation handling and retrieval.

2. **Conversational Memory**: Memory is crucial for agents to remember previous interactions with users. It helps in maintaining context and providing more coherent responses.

3. **ChatPromptTemplate**: This utility allows for flexible formatting of chat prompts, facilitating clear communication between the system and users.

4. **Output Parsing**: Various output formats can be parsed using utilities like `StrOutputParser` and `JsonOutputParser`, enhancing the versatility of the conversational agent.

5. **Document Processing**: Utilities like `Document` and `WeebBaseLoader` aid in handling document-based interactions, such as extracting text from PDF files.

6. **Retrieval Mechanism**: The system incorporates a retrieval mechanism using OpenAI embeddings and Faiss for efficient document retrieval and response generation.

7. **Agent Execution**: The Ollama framework provides functions for executing agents and handling search results, streamlining the development process.
